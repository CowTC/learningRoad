With RHEL 7 / CentOS 7, firewalld was introduced to manage iptables. IMHO, firewalld is more suited for workstations than for server environments.

将firewalld-替换为iptables

1.关闭防火墙

	1.1 systemctl stop firewalld

	1.2 systemctl mask firewalld

2. 安装iptables-services package:

	2.1 yum install iptables-services

	2.2 Enable the service at boot-time:

		systemctl enable iptables

	2.3 Managing the service

		systemctl [stop|start|restart] iptables

	2.4 Saving your firewall rules can be done as follows:
		service iptables save
		or
		/usr/libexec/iptables/iptables.init save
